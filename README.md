Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed. 133 dog breeds were considered. Trained two different deep learning models: one designed from scratch and another using transfer learning from Xception model with pre-trained coefficients. The accuracy of the test set was 85.6% for the transfer learning approach.
